Saadâ€™s Spotify Resume

The resume is what I imagine a product managers resume would look like if they were a spotify artist. Its just a bit of fun.

It involves the following technologies:
1.	Flask
2.	Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS
3.	Python
4.	Spotify API
5.	SQLAlchemy

The resume is completely FE based but the playlist page involves the spotify API

The playlist page displays a pre-made playlist that users can choose to either follow on their own Spotify or contribute to. In both cases they will follow the spotify Oauth flow and then I will add their data to my database

Constraint: The playlist needs to be manually updated (through code) but needs authorization by me, so updates might take a while to see
